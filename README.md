# PasswordGenerator

## Description

Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by Javascript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

While building the javascript file i had been inadvertently saving and git commiting it to a different folder than the folder than the one that was being commited and pushed up. I realize how that happened and will make sure it isn't an issue in the future.

Thank you to Roger, Kerwin, and Manuel for wading into the deep waters of Javascript with the class and keeping me afloat with their instruction and guidance. Thank you to my fellow classmates for including me in the study and homework sessions as working together on a problem has been a great teacher also.
